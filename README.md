# pForth online

pForth sandbox based on jor1k OpenRISC linux emulator

I just have taken [pForth source](https://github.com/philburk/pforth) and compiled it in [Jor1k emulator](https://s-macke.github.io/jor1k/demos/main.html),
then used stripped "demo" version provided by `jor1k` to construct this smaller setup, able to run **pForth** in the browser.
